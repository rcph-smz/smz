        Good day everyone! Welcome to our virtual talk show, I'm your host, Mae Pearl Ikalina.  Nowadays, technology has become a hot topic as it almost became our daily life when the pandemic started. Many say that technology is such a useful thing, for this can be used in many things such as transactions, contact, and specially this became an alternative way to attend school. But according to the research of Regis College, there can be many negative effects, not just to children, of using too much technology such as Poor Overall Health, Vision Problems, Trouble in Falling Asleep, Anxiety and Depression, Stress and Isolation, Tech Addiction, and Emotional and Attention Issues. So today, we gathered students from different places to talk about how technology makes our lives easier and how it impacts them.
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Host: So let’s start! May I call Ms. Chaidelle Escribano and Mr. Sasuman?
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Escribano and Sasuman: Good day Ms. Ikalina!
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Host: So what do you think about technology? Does it make your life easier? If yes, then how?
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        First student: Escribano From my perspective, i absolutely agree that technology can make things easier. As of now, technology is a huge help for us, students, to carry on with Online Learning. Without technology, I can now imagine how hard it is to study with that mode of learning, or maybe we can’t come up with the idea of having online classes at this time of the pandemic. However, technology has bad effects if we overused it, use it for inappropriate things, or use them in the wrong way. It may have a bad effect, but still, technology contributes a lot to our daily lives. 
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Second student: Sasuman Some teachers have worked out creative ways of Zoom-based teaching or other apps just to conduct a virtual class. These stretch beyond the streamed lecture format and include live demonstrations, experiments, and live music and pottery workshops. Social media, apps and games have proven convenient places for teachers to share insights into their classroom practice, while students can quickly show teachers and classmates what they have been working on.
        These informal uses of digital media have played an important role in boosting students, teachers and parents with a bit of human contact, and additional motivation to connect and learn. 
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Host: Alright, thank you Ms. Escribano and Mr. Sasuman! How about Ms. Casey Ng, how does technology help you?
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        3rd student: Ng Technology is a big help to us now because now we are in a pandemic which is covid19 so the family can't gather, maybe because the number of covid infections is increasing, technology is a great help even if we are not together as long as there is technology, the family seems to be together even in the video, and because of the technology, the students can continue to study even if the students only use google meet today.
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Host: Yes, it’s better to be safe nowadays. Thank you Ms. Casey Ng! Moving to the next person, Mr. Andrei Mones, what do you think about technology?
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        4th student: mones first of all is about communicating, it makes it easier for people to communicate with their friends or family and co -workers when there is an urgent task or meeting, especially when a pandemic is difficult to get out, it helps us communicate with our teachers through gmeet or other videocall applications, and another is the various types of learning platforms such as quipper and google classroom. And another is the transporting vehicles, it makes it easier to transport people to different places.
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        Host: Right, thank you Mr. Mones! Now may we call Ms. Candice Donozo and Mr. Rovic Magdamit, do you agree that technology makes your life easier? And how? 
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        5th donozo For me, yes, our lives can be made easier with technology such as online schooling or online selling etc. With the internet and gadgets, but for me technology sometimes doesn't help us because many of us most of the kids are addicted to tablets, ipads, cellphones, as if they can no longer control their use, many kids, teenagers or the elderly , that hospital because collapsed using gadgets. 
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        6th student: Rovic using technology help us making hard tasks and work easier,like lifting, calculation , listing, looping, production , and many problems of mankind. it makes us more convenient to our decision and innovate our mind , technology can be also efficient in places, like school,office,hospital,mining, etc. aside from that , technology is great invention for transportation , it makes countries and continents reach each other, applications like messenger, facebook, twitter, etc ,makes people contact each other. so people will won't worry on their relatives. technology also hold the foundation of Develop abilities to use and maintain technological products and systems that can be help for future generations. so yeah, technology is a great invention that ever made. 
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        host: It’s true that technology really made our lives easier, thank you to the both of you! Down to our last two, Mr. Cholo Carrasco and Mr. Rhedin Mero, do you think that technology made a good impact to our lives?
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        cholo: Our technology is a big help, especially like messenger, google and many others because it makes it faster for us to find meanings with the help of google, and the messenger allows us to talk on cam to our families who are far away and especially now it's a pandemic, here we are still studying like an online classes
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        mero: So in my opinion technology makes everything easier just like studying there are students who can't go to libraries maybe because it's far from their place so their best choice is to research through the Internet and you can learn a lot on the internet you can get new idea for your project, assignment etc. Technology can help a lot now, especially with a midst of a pandemic, because we were able to make a vaccine for covid with the help of modern technology.
    </div>
    <div class="split">
