        <p>
            Mortality in fish production ponds has been considered an essential
            parameter in understanding the dynamics of any population. Mortality, in general
            perspective, is synonymous to loss of life. In aquaculture, without knowledge and
            enough understanding of how fast fishes are removed from a set of population,
            it is impossible to identify the population dynamics within the pond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fish mortality is categorized into two types:
        </p>
        <p>
            1.
Natural mortality refers to the loss of population from natural sources,

which occurs after stocking. This is mainly due to stress, predation,

old-age, diseases, and in-pond water quality deterioration.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Fishing mortality refers to the loss of population from external factors
such as the fishing activities done in the pond, which affects the survival
rate of aquatic species.

        </p>
        <p>
            The mortality rate among ponds will vary depending on the size and
number of aquatic species, particularly fishes. A dead fish may float for
several days in warm water or may sink immediately after dying in cold
weather.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            Dead fish have three important environmental concerns:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. If outflow of water occurs, carcasses and associated bacteria may be
released to the ponds.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. The decomposition period of dead fish could impair in-pond water

quality and cause effluent water quality to decline.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. The bad smell from large fish kill could be a problem at the surrounding
areas.
        </p>
    </div>

        factors that contribute to fish mortality
    </header>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            Fish kill is common in any aquatic environment. It happens unexpectedly
over a short period of time involving a large number of dead fish. The following
are factors that contribute to fish mortality:

        </p>
        <img src="dead_fish.jpeg" alt="deadfish.jpeg" class="iframe">
        <p>
            A. Natural Causes of Fish Mortality
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Oxygen depletion
        </p>
        <p>
            Dissolved oxygen levels are dependent on the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            a. temperature
        </p>
        <p>
            b. pond depth
        </p>
        <p>
            c. water movement
        </p>
        <p>
            d. productivity
        </p>
        <p>
            e. fertility
        </p>
        <p>
            Oxygen depletion in aquatic environment happens when there is an

imbalance in the natural nutrient cycles. For instance, fish farmers who

over-fertilize the fishpond and place high nutrient levels from feeding
causes oxygen depletion and even, fish kills.

        </p>
        <p>
            Fish can be killed for a couple of hours in an environment where
the level of oxygen is lower than 1mg/l. Fish farmers need to be alert
during summer months because phytoplankton bloom on water with
high temperature. This causes the aquatic environment to acquire low
dissolved oxygen that could lead to fish mortality.

        </p>
        <p>
            Aquatic plants and animals use oxygen and release carbon dioxide in
respiration. Phytoplankton is responsible for producing oxygen for aquatic
plants and animals by getting enough sunlight. However, when clouds
block the sun for over a period of days, this reduces oxygen production
levels. Fish farmers should know that oxygen levels are at its lowest just
before sunrise, wherein, fish are prone to die.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            2. Presence of toxic algae
        </p>
        <p>
            When nutrient competition becomes intense, some species of algae
release toxic substances into the water. The toxins produced by algal
species can kill other algae that results in an algal population made up
of large numbers of toxin-emitting species.
        </p>
        <p>
            Algal toxins are not produced by external sources. They naturally
occur. Toxic algal blooms, harmful algal blooms (HABS), and red tides are
naturally occurring in any aquatic environment. There may be times that
human activities can contribute to the increased toxins.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            3. hydrogen sulfide
        </p>
        <p>
            Hydrogen sulfide is not only dangerous to aquatic animals but also to
humans. This can cause serious health risk and even death, if inhaled by
humans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that is commonly found at pond

bottoms. It came from different sources such as organic matters
(e.g. fish waste, tree parts, and dead dish), chemicals containing sulfur,
and mixture of salt water, among others. For instance, when organic
matters build up, they create a thin black mud, that when turnover occurs,
releases hydrogen sulfide gas that smells like a rotten egg. A turnover
happens when the surface water mixes with water near the bottom.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            4. Mortality due to bacteria or parasites
        </p>
        <p>
            All aquatic animals are vulnerable to disease-causing bacteria,
viruses, and fungi. It can also be infected by parasites such as lice,
tapeworms, and leeches. These organisms are found at low levels in
aquatic environment with limited number of fish. Massive fish kill is

seldom caused by these organisms. Diagnosing bacterial infections are
difficult to do. However, these may appear as bloody rings or streaks on
the skin or at the edges of fish scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fish mortality due to parasitic infections begins slowly with only one
or few fish each day. As parasites multiply, the number of dead fish
continue to increase over time. It will only cause severity in mortality

rate of fishes when the aquatic environment is crowded, when most of
the aquatic animals are stressed or starving, and when the temperature
or the level of chemical toxins are high.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
           B. Unnatural causes of fish mortallity
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Pesticides
        </p>
        <p>
            In agricultural areas, pesticide runoff has been known to kill fishes.
When the newly applied pesticides are washed off by the rain into the
ponds, lakes, or streams, its concentration level can be dangerous to
aquatic animals, especially when it reaches the lethal level. Pesticides
that are improperly applied to aquatic organisms also lead to fish kill.

Some of the signs of fishes affected by pesticides are spinal curves,
dark reddish discoloration, loss of equilibrium, convulsion, and death.
Smaller fishes will die first, unlike in oxygen depletion, where larger
fishes die first.

        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, when a pond owner uses pesticides to control ticks
and chiggers near the fishpond area, it can easily cause fish mortality.
Fish farmers and pond owners need to take extra precautions when
applying any chemical, especially near the fishpond area. Factors such

as weather and temperature should be monitored. Commonly used
herbicides are usually not detrimental to fishes. However, it may render
the fishes inedible for human consumption and may prevent livestock
from using the water for up to 2 to 3 weeks.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            2. Salt water
        </p>
        <p>
            Different fishes have different water requirements to stay alive. This
involves the proper salinity level, pH level, and other parameters. Fish
farmers also know that placing freshwater fishes to salt water can kill
the fishes and other aquatic animals.

        </p>
        <p>
            Salt water can come from septic systems, livestock salt licks, and
other sources that can enter the pond. To check the saltiness of the
water in a pond, fish farmers use chemical test kits. Monitoring the
quality of water, such as the salinity level in pond, prevents fish kill.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            3. sewage
        </p>
        <p>
            A poorly maintained septic system or a broken pipe can be a source
of a raw sewage that can enter the fishpond and cause fish kill. The
sewage is not usually toxic to the fish. However, it consumes the available
oxygen as it decays that triggers a low dissolved oxygen, resulting for
fish to die.
        </p>
        <p>
            
With the loaded nutrients found in sewage, intense algal blooms may
possibly occur. When the algae reach a density sufficient to shade itself
out, these would result in a partial or complete die-off of phytoplankton.
When this happens, dead phytoplankton decays may use up enough
available oxygen to cause a fish kill.

        Ways to Dispose aquacultures mortalities
    </header>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            In establishing an aquaculture facility such as fishpond, it is important for fish
farmers to consider the volume of the stock they have on-site and their capacity
to manage mortalities. Here are the proper ways on how to dispose dead fishes
and other aquatic animals
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Composting is a controlled biological treatment that transforms
aquaculture mortalities into a valuable on-farm resource. If a fish farmer
intends to use this method, the site must be far away from surface
water to avoid pond contamination. To facilitate the breakdown of the
shell of mollusks and crustaceans, crushing them prior to composting

is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Reusing or recycling does not harm the environment. Fish carcasses
            can be used as fertilizers and shells from shellfish can be used to create
            useful handicraft products. However, this method is not appropriate
            when the cause of death of aquatic animals are due to certain diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Rendering refers to the heating process that extracts usable ingredients
            such as protein meals and fats. This method must be undertaken by a
            licensed professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Waste depot (landfill) is done by depositing fish carcasses in a licensed
waste depot. Dead stocks must be stored and transported appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. On-site burial is usually a preferred option for fish farmers. This is quick
and can be achieved easily. The quantities of dead stock, proximity to
surface water and groundwater, location of the site, and permeability of
soil should be considered by fish farmers who are using this method.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Cremation or burning is only considered if the disposal of aquaculture
mortalities using the other methods like composting and recycling are
not part of the options. This method generates air pollution. Other
materials such as sawdust, paper, and timber off cuts may need to be
added to assist the burning process. Shellfish are not suitable to burn

because of their hard shells. Burning aquatic animals in small quantities
may be appropriate in some circumstances. However, fish farmers need
to ensure that the process will not create an environmental nuisance
like air pollution and bad odors to neighboring properties.

        Predators in aquaculture
    </header>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            A predator is an animal that preys on aquaculture species like fishes,
mollusks, and crustaceans. It can cause damages to farm facilities directly or
indirectly. Direct damage is manifested when the fish or other cultured organisms are killed or seriously damaged by the predator and lost from the production.
Indirect damage includes non-lethal wounding of fish; chronic stress with a

consequent reduction in feeding efficiency or health; transfer of harmful disease-
causing organisms, like bacteria, viruses and parasites; and sometimes, even
physical damage to aquatic animals.

        Common Fish Predators
    </header>
    <div class="split">
        <p>
            1. Birds are the major reasons
of fish loss at aquaculture
facilities. These can have a
significant economic impact on

operations. Aside from attacking
the fish, these predators can
injure fish, disrupt the feeding

activity, disturb the bloodstock,
and contribute to the spread
of diseases and parasites in aquaculture ponds. Normally, these predators attack in open water and

high fish stocking densities at aquaculture facilities.

        <img src="bird.jpeg" alt="bird.jpeg" class="iframe">
        <p>
            2. Fishes also attack other fish stocks that causes much stress. It is
suggested to use screens in the inlets and the outlets. Periodical pond
draining is advised.

            3. 
            Frogs and toads usually attack juvenile tilapia and catfish. To avoid
            these predators, clearing the bushes around the area is recommended.

            4. Insects and insect larvae attack juvenile fish, eggs, and fish that just

hatched. As a control measure, fish farmers are advised to use fish that
feed on insect larvae like those that have gills and can remain at the
bottom.

            5. Human (theft) attacks all types of fish in the pond and considered as
one of the major fish predators. Human attack is mostly common in cage
culture and other intensive fish farming. However, it can be controlled
through employing security personnel, use of trained dogs, and fencing
of the farm.

            6. Snakes destroy larval and juvenile fish. To avoid these predators, fence
properly and clear the bushes around the pond.
As a fish farmer, it is your responsibility to know the possible predators

in your pond. This will ensure fresh, quality fish harvests that are not injured and
of good market value aside from the benefit of earning high income because of
good harvest returns.

        Disinfection of aquaculture establishments

        <p>
            In an aquaculture establishment, disinfection is employed as a disease
management tool. The disinfection of aquaculture establishments involves
chemical treatment application and sufficient concentrations for a specific period
of time in order to kill pathogenic organisms that have a direct contact with the
surrounding water systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            
It is difficult to disinfect permeable surfaces as this requires more time. The
disinfection capacity of most disinfectants is reduced due to the presence of
organic matter. It is recommended to filter influent water.

        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to disinfection, all surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned. The detergents
and disinfectants to be used should be compatible with the surface being

treated, and the wastes produced from washing should be disinfected before
disposal. Procedures of disinfection should be established and used based on
the objectives of disinfection and risks. Remove all aquatic animals from the
pond, either dead or alive. Diseased aquatic animals should be harvested or
humanely killed prior to disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following are stages of washing and disinfecting an aquaculture facility:

        <p>
            5. Rinsing
        </p>
        <p>
            Before washing and disinfecting an aquaculture facility, fish farmers must
wear appropriate body protections such as face mask, eye protections, and
gloves. Store the disinfectants properly and ensure that no direct or indirect
danger to animal or human health and the environment will be involved.
